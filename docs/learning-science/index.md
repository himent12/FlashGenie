## 🔬 **How FlashGenie Implements Science**

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm

FlashGenie uses an enhanced SM-2 algorithm with modern improvements:

```python
def calculate_next_interval(self, card: Flashcard, quality: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate optimal review interval based on SM-2 algorithm.
    
    Enhanced with:
    - Confidence weighting
    - Response time analysis
    - Difficulty adaptation
    - Individual learning curves
    """
    base_interval = self.sm2_interval(card.easiness, card.interval, quality)
    
    # Apply confidence weighting
    confidence_factor = self.calculate_confidence_factor(card.confidence_history)
    
    # Apply response time adjustment
    speed_factor = self.calculate_speed_factor(card.response_times)
    
    # Apply individual learning curve
    personal_factor = self.calculate_personal_factor(card.user_performance)
    
    return base_interval * confidence_factor * speed_factor * personal_factor
```

### Difficulty Adaptation Research

```

### Neuroplasticity and Learning

FlashGenie leverages neuroplasticity principles:

**Synaptic Strengthening**
: Repeated retrieval strengthens neural pathways

**Myelination**
: Spaced practice promotes myelin formation for faster signal transmission

**Neurogenesis**
: Challenging but achievable tasks promote new neuron formation

**Long-Term Potentiation**
: Optimal timing enhances synaptic efficiency

### Attention and Focus

FlashGenie optimizes attention through:

**Focused Attention Mode**
: Single-task focus during quiz sessions

**Attention Restoration**
: Breaks between difficult cards prevent cognitive fatigue

**Selective Attention**
: Difficulty-based filtering focuses on relevant content

**Sustained Attention**
: Progressive difficulty maintains engagement

## 🎯 **Optimization Principles**

### Desirable Difficulties

FlashGenie implements "desirable difficulties" that enhance learning:

**Retrieval Difficulty**
: Slightly challenging recall strengthens memory

**Spacing Difficulty**
: Longer intervals require more effort but improve retention

**Interleaving Difficulty**
: Mixed practice improves discrimination and transfer

**Generation Difficulty**
: Producing answers (vs. recognition) enhances encoding

### Cognitive Load Management

    - Plateau and Breakthrough Cycles
    """
    performance_data = user_data.get_performance_history()
    
    # Fit multiple learning curve models
    power_law_fit = self.fit_power_law(performance_data)
    exponential_fit = self.fit_exponential(performance_data)
    s_curve_fit = self.fit_s_curve(performance_data)
    
    # Select best-fitting model
    best_model = self.select_best_model([power_law_fit, exponential_fit, s_curve_fit])
    
    return LearningPattern(
        model=best_model,
        predicted_mastery_time=self.predict_mastery(best_model),
        optimization_suggestions=self.generate_suggestions(best_model)
    )
```

### Forgetting Curves
