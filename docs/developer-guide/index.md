## üîå **Extension Points**

FlashGenie is designed for extensibility:

### Custom Algorithms

Implement your own learning algorithms:

```python
from flashgenie.core.difficulty_analyzer import DifficultyAnalyzer

class MyCustomAnalyzer(DifficultyAnalyzer):
    def analyze_performance(self, card, responses):
        # Your custom analysis logic
        return performance_metrics
    
    def suggest_difficulty_adjustment(self, performance):
        # Your custom adjustment logic
        return difficulty_change
```

### Custom Importers

Add support for new file formats:

```python
from flashgenie.data.importers.base import BaseImporter

class MyFormatImporter(BaseImporter):
    def can_import(self, file_path):
        return file_path.endswith('.myformat')
    
    def import_flashcards(self, file_path):
        # Your import logic
        return flashcards
```

### Custom Collections

Create new smart collection types:

```python
from flashgenie.core.smart_collections import BaseCollection

class MyCustomCollection(BaseCollection):
    def get_criteria(self):
        return "Custom criteria description"
    
    def filter_cards(self, cards):
        # Your filtering logic
        return filtered_cards
```

## üìä **Development Metrics**
