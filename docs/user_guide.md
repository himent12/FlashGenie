What does CPU stand for?,Central Processing Unit
```

### TXT Format

# Import from file
flashgenie import flashcards.csv

# Import with custom name

## Understanding Spaced Repetition

FlashGenie uses the SM-2 algorithm to optimize when you review each card:

- **New cards**: Reviewed immediately
- **Easy cards**: Longer intervals between reviews
- **Difficult cards**: More frequent reviews
- **Forgotten cards**: Reset to shorter intervals

### Performance Factors

The algorithm considers:
- **Response accuracy**: Whether you answered correctly
- **Response time**: How quickly you answered
- **Historical performance**: Your past performance with the card

## Tips for Effective Learning

1. **Study regularly**: Consistent daily sessions are more effective than cramming
2. **Be honest**: Mark answers as incorrect if you weren't confident
3. **Use quality ratings**: The algorithm works better with accurate feedback
4. **Review due cards**: Focus on cards that are due for review
5. **Create good cards**: Clear, specific questions work best

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import fails with encoding error**:
- Try saving your file with UTF-8 encoding
- Check for special characters in your text

**No cards due for review**:
- This is normal! It means you're learning effectively
- Import new cards or wait for existing cards to become due

**Quiz seems too easy/hard**:
- The algorithm adapts to your performance over time
- Be patient and provide honest feedback

### Getting Help

- Use the `help` command for quick reference
- Check the documentation in the `docs/` folder
- Report issues on GitHub: https://github.com/himent12/FlashGenie
