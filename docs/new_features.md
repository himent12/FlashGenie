# 🚀 FlashGenie New Features: Smart Difficulty & Advanced Tagging

This document describes the two major enhancements added to FlashGenie:

1. **Smart Card Difficulty Auto-Adjustment** - Intelligent difficulty adaptation based on performance
2. **Advanced Tagging and Smart Collections** - Hierarchical tagging and dynamic card grouping

## 🎯 Smart Card Difficulty Auto-Adjustment

### Overview
FlashGenie now automatically adjusts card difficulty based on multiple performance factors, creating a truly personalized learning experience.

### How It Works

#### Performance Analysis
The system analyzes:
- **Response Time**: How quickly you answer questions
- **Accuracy Patterns**: Your success rate over time
- **Confidence Ratings**: Your self-assessed confidence (1-5 scale)
- **Learning Trends**: Whether performance is improving or declining
- **Consistency**: How stable your performance is

#### Automatic Adjustments
- **High Accuracy + Fast Response**: Difficulty increases gradually
- **Low Accuracy + Slow Response**: Difficulty decreases to help learning
- **Inconsistent Performance**: Difficulty adjusts to find optimal challenge level
- **Confidence Mismatch**: Adjusts when confidence doesn't match performance

#### User Benefits
- **Personalized Learning**: Cards adapt to your individual learning patterns
- **Optimal Challenge**: Maintains the perfect difficulty level for retention
- **Reduced Frustration**: Automatically eases difficult cards
- **Accelerated Progress**: Increases challenge when you're ready

### Using the Feature

#### During Quiz Sessions
```bash
# Start a quiz - you'll be asked for confidence ratings
python -m flashgenie quiz "My Deck"

# After answering, you'll see:
Your answer: Paris
✓ Correct!

How confident were you? (1=Very Low, 2=Low, 3=Medium, 4=High, 5=Very High, or press Enter to skip): 4

# The system may show difficulty adjustments:
Difficulty adjusted: Difficulty increased slightly based on high accuracy, fast response times
```

#### Viewing Difficulty Changes
```bash
# Load a deck and check stats
load "My Deck"
stats

# You'll see recent difficulty adjustments:
Recent Difficulty Adjustments: 3 cards
  What is the capital of France?... - Difficulty increased slightly based on high accuracy
  What does CPU stand for?... - Difficulty decreased moderately based on low accuracy
```

### Technical Details

#### Difficulty Factors
- **Accuracy Weight**: 30% - Primary factor for adjustment
- **Response Time Weight**: 40% - Speed indicates mastery level
- **Confidence Weight**: 30% - User's self-assessment
- **Trend Factors**: 10% - Recent performance changes

#### Adjustment Limits
- **Maximum Change**: 0.2 per review (prevents dramatic swings)
- **Minimum Reviews**: 3 reviews needed before adjustments begin
- **Range**: Difficulty stays between 0.0 (easiest) and 1.0 (hardest)

#### Data Tracking
Each card now tracks:
- Last 20 response times
- Last 20 confidence ratings
- Last 10 difficulty values
- Timestamps of all adjustments
- Reasons for each change

## 🏷️ Advanced Tagging and Smart Collections

### Overview
FlashGenie now supports hierarchical tagging, automatic content analysis, and smart collections that dynamically group cards based on various criteria.

### Hierarchical Tagging

#### Creating Tag Hierarchies
```bash
# Create hierarchical tags
tags create "Science > Biology > Cell Structure"
tags create "Programming > Python > Data Structures"
tags create "Languages > Spanish > Grammar > Verbs"

# The system creates the full hierarchy automatically
```

#### Tag Features
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Organize tags in logical hierarchies
- **Auto-Completion**: System suggests related tags
- **Aliases**: Create shortcuts (e.g., "math" → "mathematics")
- **Inheritance**: Child tags inherit parent properties

### Auto-Tagging

#### Content Analysis
The system analyzes flashcard content and suggests relevant tags:

```bash
# Automatically tag all cards in current deck
autotag

# Result:
✓ Added tags to 12 cards

# View tag suggestions for specific cards
tags suggest

# Result:
Card: What is the quadratic formula?...
Suggested tags: mathematics, algebra, advanced
```

#### Built-in Patterns
Auto-tagging recognizes:
- **Academic Subjects**: math, science, history, language
- **Programming**: python, javascript, algorithms, data structures
- **Difficulty Levels**: basic, intermediate, advanced
- **Content Types**: definitions, formulas, facts, procedures

### Smart Collections

#### Predefined Collections
FlashGenie creates several smart collections automatically:

```bash
# View all collections and their statistics
collections

# Result:
Smart Collections

- Hard Cards (0.7-1.0 difficulty)

**Performance-Based Collections**
- Struggling Cards (low accuracy)

#### Creating Custom Collections

```python
# Example: Create a collection for advanced math cards
from flashgenie.core.smart_collections import SmartCollectionManager
from flashgenie.core.tag_manager import TagManager

tag_manager = TagManager()
collection_manager = SmartCollectionManager(tag_manager)

# Create tag-based collection
math_collection = collection_manager.create_tag_collection(
    "Advanced Math",
    required_tags=["mathematics"],
    any_of_tags=["advanced", "calculus", "algebra"]
)

# Create performance-based collection
review_collection = collection_manager.create_performance_collection(
    "Needs Review",
    max_accuracy=0.7,
    min_reviews=3
)
```

### Enhanced CLI Commands

#### New Commands
```bash
# Tag management
tags                    # Show tag statistics
tags create <path>      # Create hierarchical tag
tags suggest           # Suggest tags for untagged cards

# Auto-tagging
autotag                # Automatically tag current deck

# Smart collections
collections            # Show all collections and stats
```

#### Enhanced Existing Commands
```bash
# Enhanced stats with difficulty tracking
stats

# Shows:
# - Difficulty distribution
# - Recent difficulty adjustments
# - Tag usage statistics
# - Performance trends

# Enhanced quiz with confidence ratings
quiz

# Now asks for confidence after each answer:
# "How confident were you? (1-5 or Enter to skip)"
```

### Integration with Spaced Repetition

#### Enhanced Algorithm
The spaced repetition algorithm now considers:
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Adjusts intervals based on current difficulty
- **Confidence Levels**: Higher confidence = longer intervals
- **Performance Trends**: Improving performance = increased intervals
- **Tag-Based Patterns**: Similar cards inform scheduling

#### Smart Scheduling
- **Adaptive Intervals**: Based on difficulty and performance
- **Confidence Weighting**: User confidence affects next review date
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from similar cards in collections
- **Trend Analysis**: Adjusts for improving or declining performance

### Data Storage

#### Enhanced Flashcard Data
Each flashcard now stores:
```json
{
  "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
  "answer": "Process plants use to convert light to energy",
  "tags": ["biology", "plants", "intermediate"],
  "difficulty": 0.45,
  "response_times": [3.2, 2.8, 4.1, 2.5],
  "confidence_ratings": [3, 4, 3, 4],
  "difficulty_history": [0.5, 0.48, 0.45],

        "new_difficulty": 0.45,
        "reason": "Difficulty decreased slightly based on high accuracy"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Tag Hierarchies
```json
{
  "hierarchies": {
    "science": {
      "name": "science",
      "parent": null,
      "children": ["biology", "chemistry", "physics"],
      "description": "Natural sciences"
    },
    "biology": {
      "name": "biology", 
      "parent": "science",
      "children": ["cell_biology", "genetics"],
      "description": "Study of living organisms"
    }
  },
  "aliases": {
    "bio": "biology",
    "chem": "chemistry"
  }
}
```
