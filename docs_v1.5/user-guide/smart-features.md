# 🧠 Smart Features

FlashGenie's intelligent features set it apart from traditional flashcard applications. This guide explores the smart systems that adapt to your learning style and optimize your study experience.

## 🎯 **Overview of Smart Features**

FlashGenie includes four core intelligent systems that work together:

1. **[Smart Difficulty Auto-Adjustment](#smart-difficulty-auto-adjustment)** - Cards adapt to your performance
2. **[Hierarchical Tagging System](#hierarchical-tagging)** - Intelligent content organization
3. **[Smart Collections](#smart-collections)** - Dynamic card grouping
4. **[Analytics and Insights](#analytics-and-insights)** - Comprehensive learning analytics

These systems learn from your behavior and continuously optimize your learning experience.

## 🎚️ **Smart Difficulty Auto-Adjustment**

### What is Smart Difficulty?

Smart Difficulty is FlashGenie's most innovative feature. Unlike traditional flashcard apps where difficulty is static, FlashGenie automatically adjusts each card's difficulty based on your performance, creating a personalized learning experience.

### How It Works

The system analyzes multiple factors to determine optimal difficulty:

=== "📊 Performance Factors"

    **Accuracy Rate**
    : How often you answer the card correctly
    
    **Response Time**
    : How quickly you answer (faster = easier for you)
    
    **Confidence Levels**
    : Your self-assessed confidence (1-5 scale)
    
    **Learning Trends**
    : Whether you're improving or struggling over time
    
    **Consistency**
    : How stable your performance is

=== "⚡ Real-Time Adaptation"

    **Immediate Adjustments**
    : Difficulty changes after each review
    
    **Gradual Changes**
    : Maximum 0.2 difficulty change per review
    
    **Explanations**
    : Clear reasons for each adjustment
    
    **History Tracking**
    : Complete record of difficulty changes

### Experiencing Smart Difficulty

During a quiz session, you'll see difficulty adjustments in real-time:

```bash
Question: What is photosynthesis?
Your answer: The process plants use to convert light to energy
✓ Correct!

How confident were you? (1=Very Low, 2=Low, 3=Medium, 4=High, 5=Very High): 4

# FlashGenie provides immediate feedback:
Difficulty adjusted: Difficulty increased slightly based on high accuracy, fast response times
```

### Understanding Difficulty Levels

FlashGenie uses a 0.0 to 1.0 difficulty scale:

| Range | Level | Characteristics | Review Frequency |
|-------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| 0.0-0.3 | **Easy** | High accuracy, fast responses | Longer intervals |
| 0.3-0.7 | **Medium** | Moderate performance | Standard intervals |
| 0.7-1.0 | **Hard** | Lower accuracy, needs practice | Shorter intervals |

### Confidence Ratings

Your confidence ratings (1-5 scale) help FlashGenie understand the difference between lucky guesses and true knowledge:

!!! tip "Using Confidence Ratings Effectively"
    
    - **1 (Very Low)**: Complete guess, no idea
    - **2 (Low)**: Uncertain, might be wrong
    - **3 (Medium)**: Somewhat confident
    - **4 (High)**: Very confident, likely correct
    - **5 (Very High)**: Absolutely certain
    
    **Be honest!** The system learns better from accurate self-assessment.

### Viewing Difficulty Changes

See how your cards have adapted over time:

```bash
python -m flashgenie stats

# Shows recent difficulty adjustments:
Recent Difficulty Adjustments: 12 cards
  What is photosynthesis?... - Difficulty increased based on high accuracy
  What is DNA structure?... - Difficulty decreased based on low accuracy
  What is mitosis?... - Difficulty maintained - performance is stable
```

## 🏷️ **Hierarchical Tagging**

### What is Hierarchical Tagging?

FlashGenie's tagging system goes beyond simple labels. You can create hierarchical tag structures that mirror how knowledge is actually organized.

### Creating Tag Hierarchies

Build logical knowledge structures:

```bash
# Create hierarchical tags
python -m flashgenie tags create "Science > Biology > Cell Structure"
python -m flashgenie tags create "Science > Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"
python -m flashgenie tags create "Languages > Spanish > Grammar > Verbs"
```

This creates a tree structure:
```
Science
├── Biology
│   ├── Cell Structure
│   ├── Genetics
│   └── Ecology
└── Chemistry
    ├── Organic Chemistry
    └── Inorganic Chemistry
```

### Auto-Tagging

FlashGenie can automatically suggest tags based on content analysis:

```bash
# Auto-tag your current deck
python -m flashgenie autotag

# Result:
✓ Added tags to 23 cards

# View suggestions for specific cards
python -m flashgenie tags suggest

# Shows:
Card: What is the quadratic formula?...
Suggested tags: mathematics, algebra, advanced
```

### Built-in Tag Recognition

FlashGenie recognizes common patterns and suggests appropriate tags:

=== "📚 Academic Subjects"

    - **Mathematics**: algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics
    - **Science**: biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy
    - **History**: ancient, medieval, modern, wars
    - **Languages**: grammar, vocabulary, literature

=== "💻 Programming"

    - **Languages**: python, javascript, java, c++
    - **Concepts**: algorithms, data structures, databases
    - **Frameworks**: react, django, flask, spring

=== "📈 Difficulty Levels"

    - **Beginner**: basic, fundamental, introduction
    - **Intermediate**: moderate, standard
    - **Advanced**: complex, difficult, expert

### Tag Management

```bash
# View tag statistics
python -m flashgenie tags

# Create tag aliases
python -m flashgenie tags create "math" --alias-for "mathematics"

# View tag hierarchy
python -m flashgenie tags list --hierarchy
```

## 📦 **Smart Collections**

### What are Smart Collections?

Smart Collections are dynamic groups that automatically organize your flashcards based on various criteria. Unlike static folders, these collections update automatically as your cards change.

### Built-in Collections

FlashGenie creates several collections automatically:

=== "🎯 Difficulty-Based"

    **Easy Cards** (0.0-0.3 difficulty)
    : Cards you've mastered or find straightforward
    
    **Medium Cards** (0.3-0.7 difficulty)
    : Cards at optimal challenge level
    
    **Hard Cards** (0.7-1.0 difficulty)
    : Cards that need more practice

=== "📊 Performance-Based"

    **Struggling Cards**
    : Cards with accuracy below 60%
    
    **Mastered Cards**
    : Cards with accuracy above 90%
    
    **Inconsistent Cards**
    : Cards with variable performance

=== "⏰ Time-Based"

    **Due for Review**
    : Cards scheduled for review today
    
    **Recently Added**
    : Cards added in the last 7 days
    
    **Long Overdue**
    : Cards past their review date
