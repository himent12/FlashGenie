## 🎉 **Welcome to FlashGenie v1.5!**

We're thrilled to announce the release of FlashGenie v1.5, a revolutionary update that transforms FlashGenie from a smart flashcard application into an **AI-powered intelligent learning platform**. This release represents months of development, research integration, and user feedback incorporation to create the most advanced open-source spaced repetition system available.

## 🌟 **What Makes v1.5 Special**

FlashGenie v1.5 isn't just an update—it's a complete reimagining of what flashcard learning can be. By integrating cutting-edge AI algorithms with proven cognitive science research, we've created a learning companion that:

- **🧠 Thinks with you**: Adapts to your learning patterns and context
- **📈 Predicts your progress**: Uses AI to forecast your learning journey
- **🎯 Personalizes your experience**: Tailors every aspect to your needs
- **🎮 Motivates your learning**: Gamifies the experience with achievements and streaks
- **💡 Guides your growth**: Suggests optimal content and study strategies

## 🚀 **Major New Features**

### 🧠 **1. Adaptive Study Sessions**
*The future of personalized learning*

FlashGenie now creates intelligent study plans that adapt to your:
- **Available time** (5 minutes to 2+ hours)
- **Energy level** (1-5 scale with automatic detection)
- **Environment** (quiet home, noisy public, commuting)
- **Device type** (desktop, tablet, smartphone)
- **Learning goals** (maintenance, acquisition, mastery, review)

**Example**: Planning a 30-minute morning session with high energy in a quiet environment will create a different study plan than a 10-minute commute session on your phone.

```bash
# Create an adaptive study plan
python -m flashgenie plan "Spanish Vocabulary" --time 30 --energy 4 --environment quiet
```

### 📈 **2. Learning Velocity Tracking**
*Know exactly where you're going*

Advanced analytics that track your learning velocity and predict your future:
- **Cards per day**: How fast you're learning new material
- **Mastery per day**: Rate of achieving deep understanding
- **Study efficiency**: Cards learned per minute of study time
- **Mastery prediction**: AI forecasts when you'll master your deck
- **Bottleneck identification**: Find cards that slow your progress
- **Acceleration opportunities**: Get suggestions to speed up learning

**Example**: "Based on your current velocity of 3.2 cards mastered per day, you'll achieve 90% mastery of this deck in 23 days (confidence: 85%)"

```bash
# Analyze your learning velocity
python -m flashgenie velocity "Biology" --predict --trends
```

### 🌍 **3. Contextual Learning Engine**
*Learning that adapts to your world*

The engine automatically detects and adapts to your context:
- **Time-of-day optimization**: Leverages your circadian rhythms
- **Environment adaptation**: Adjusts for noise, distractions, interruptions
- **Device optimization**: Perfect experience on any device
- **Attention-aware**: Adapts difficulty based on your focus level
- **Interruption handling**: Gracefully handles study interruptions

**Example**: Studying on your phone during a noisy commute will automatically enable visual feedback, reduce audio cues, and select easier cards for better focus.

### 🕸️ **4. Knowledge Graph Visualization**
*See your learning come together*

Visual representation of your knowledge that shows:
- **Concept relationships**: How topics connect and build on each other
- **Mastery progression**: Color-coded visualization of your progress
- **Learning paths**: Optimal routes through your knowledge
- **Knowledge gaps**: Visual identification of missing pieces
- **Progress tracking**: Watch your understanding grow over time

**Example**: See how "Spanish Grammar" connects to "Verb Conjugation" and "Sentence Structure", with mastery levels color-coded from red (unknown) to green (mastered).

```bash
# Generate your knowledge graph
python -m flashgenie graph "Chemistry" --export knowledge_map.html --format html
```

### 🏆 **5. Gamification & Achievement System**
*Make learning addictively fun*

Comprehensive motivation system with:
- **20+ Achievements** across 6 categories (streak, accuracy, volume, speed, difficulty, mastery)
- **Study streaks** (daily, weekly, accuracy, perfect streaks)
- **Level progression** with points and rewards
- **Challenge system** for competitive learning
- **Progress celebration** with visual feedback and unlocks

**Example Achievements**:
- 🎯 **First Steps**: Complete your first study session (50 points)
- 🔥 **Week Warrior**: Study for 7 consecutive days (200 points)
- 💯 **Perfectionist**: Achieve 100% accuracy in a session (150 points)
- 🏆 **Thousand Master**: Review 1000 cards (2000 points)

```bash
# Check your achievements and streaks
python -m flashgenie achievements --streaks --progress
```

Smart recommendations that help you learn better:
- **New card suggestions**: AI generates flashcard ideas based on your gaps
- **Related topic discovery**: Find topics that complement your studies
- **Prerequisite gap detection**: Identify missing foundational knowledge
- **Content gap analysis**: Find holes in your knowledge coverage
- **Study sequence optimization**: Get the optimal order for learning topics

**Example**: "Based on your progress in 'Spanish Verbs', I suggest adding cards about 'Subjunctive Mood' and studying 'Present Tense' before 'Past Perfect'."

```bash
# Get AI-powered suggestions
python -m flashgenie suggest "Physics" --cards 5 --topics --gaps
```
