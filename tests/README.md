## Development Guidelines

### When to Run Tests

- **Before committing changes** - Run comprehensive tests to ensure nothing is broken
- **After adding new features** - Verify integration with existing components
- **Before releases** - Complete validation of all functionality

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features to FlashGenie:

1. Add unit tests for individual components
2. Update the comprehensive test suite if needed
3. Ensure all tests pass before committing

### Test Dependencies

The comprehensive test requires:
- Rich Terminal UI components
- All three v1.8.5 phases (Quiz, Statistics, AI)
- Core FlashGenie components (Deck, Flashcard, etc.)

Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: Make sure you're running from the FlashGenie root directory and all dependencies are installed.

**Rich UI Not Available**: The comprehensive test requires Rich Terminal UI. Install with `pip install rich`.

**Test Failures**: Check the error output for specific component failures and verify the related code.

### Getting Help

If tests fail or you need help with testing:
1. Check the error output for specific failure details
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure you're running from the correct directory
4. Review the test code to understand what's being validated

The comprehensive test suite is designed to catch integration issues and ensure all v1.8.5 features work together correctly.
